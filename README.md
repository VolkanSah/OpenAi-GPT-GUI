# OpenAI GPT GUI + ASSI (does not run!) DEV-STATUS!
###### this GUI is not provided by Openai!
This GUI is a minimalist, multiplatform tool for interacting with OpenAI's GPT models. The application allows you to send text messages to the GPT API and receive responses. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, which can be easily customized or extended to suit specific needs.

## Philosophy

The motivation behind this GUI is to maintain a minimalist approach when interacting with the GPT API. The goal is to avoid the necessity of installing large packages, whether through Docker, npm, or other frameworks, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. In an age where complexity often overshadows simplicity, LocalGPT strives to remain lightweight and easily extensible. This application serves as a foundational base, easily adaptable for creating desktop applications with interfaces for GPT APIs, especially useful for client projects.

## Features

- Communicate with various GPT models including GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and others.
- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface.
- Clear chat history and log output functionalities.
- Adjustable settings for model selection, temperature, and max tokens.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `tkinter` library (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the project files**:
2. **Install required libraries**:
 ```

3. **Prepare the settings**:
   - Create a `settings.json` file in the project directory or rename examples to `settings.json`.
   - Use the following structure for the settings file
  
##### Windows
```
     {
       "working_directory": "C:\\path\\to\\working\\directory",
       "openai_api_key": "your_openai_api_key_here"
     }
```
##### Linux/Unix 
```
     {
       "working_directory": "/path/to/working/directory",
       "openai_api_key": "your_openai_api_key_here"
     }
 ```


## Usage
